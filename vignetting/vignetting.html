    <h3>SDSS-IV: Surveys and Instrumentation</h3>
    <p>
      The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) is a dual-hemisphere astronomical
      survey studying and mapping all aspects of the Milky Way galaxy and universe. SDSS-IV
      collects data with multiple telescopes between two observatories; Apache Point Observatory
      (APO) in the northern hemisphere, and Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) in the south.
      SDSS-IV is comprised of three active surveys: MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO),
      collecting spectral data on galaxies to understand their life cycles and processes;
      eBOSS (Extended Baryon Oscillation
      Spectroscopic Survey), a cosmology survey observing galaxies and high energy
      quasars to better understand the universe's structure and dynamics; APOGEE-2 (APO Galactic
      Evolution Experiment 2), the next generation of SDSS's Milky Way survey, collecting
      spectroscopic data from stars within our galaxy to examine the Milky Way's physical
      structure and kinematic processes. APOGEE-2 is a high resolution (R ~ 22,500),
      near-infrared (wavelength range: 1.51-1.70 micrometers) spectrograph at the
      APO observatory. The LCO telescope has a duplicated version of this spectrograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      SDSS-IV surveys have the unique ability to collect data on multiple objects simultaneously,
      while many other telescopes historically have not had this capability. This is achieved by
      using fiber optic cables and 'plug plates', specially-machined circular plates with precisely
      drilled holes where fibers plug in and collect light. The holes on each plate line up with pre-selected
      observational targets and points for calibration. Each survey uses a different number of fibers, with
      300 total used in APOGEE-2. Three types of fibers collect data while observing for APOGEE-2S: target
      (250 fibers), telluric calibration to subtract atmospheric effects (15 fibers), and sky calibration (35 fibers).
    </p>
    <p>
      Observations for APOGEE-2 in the south use the 2.5 meter du Pont telescope at LCO. The differences
      between the du Pont telescope and the Sloan 2.5 meter at APO become critical in a discussion
      of vignetting, the focus of this discussion.

    <h3>Vignetting at the du Pont Telescope</h3>
      <p>
        Vignetting is a reduction in expected brightness near the outer edges of the
        telescope's field of view (FOV). This decrease can result from the telescope
        optics, or potentially other causes such as poor fiber performance. For the
        APOGEE-2 surveys, vignetting is a problem only in southern observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The du Pont telescope was built in the 1970s, years before specialized planning
        and construction of survey telescopes existed. The Sloan 2.5 meter, built in the
        1990s, has a 3 degree field of view and an optics system designed with the goals
        of galactic surveys in mind. Sloan's FOV, f-ratio, and mirror system were optimized
        with the intention of collecting high-volume spectroscopic data. This is not the
        case for the du Pont. With a smaller FOV at 2.1 degrees and less optical corrections
        for distortion, APOGEE-2S data experiences vignetting, while the north observations
        do not. Therefore, quality assurance of southern data must incorporate the effects of
        vignetting in data reduction.
      </p>

    <h4>Significance of Vignetting</h4>
    <p>
      The decrease in brightness around a field's edges means outer fiber fluxes are
      smaller than expected, and therefore reported magnitudes will be less than the object's
      true value unless corrected for. Targets near the field's center may yield accurate
      magnitude data, while outer targets may have inconsistent or varying measurements.
      For a massive stellar survey such as APOGEE-2, the integrity of the data is then challenged.
      If target magnitudes and other calculations deviate much farther than anticipated,
      results dependent on affected APOGEE-2S data could be questionable. Though there are other
      sources of poor data quality such as decreased fiber performance or guide fiber
      inconsistencies, vignetting is a point of concern for the south's spectroscopic data.
    </p>

    <h4>Potential Project Path for Vignetting Quality Assurance</h4>
    <p>
      Given a longer-term time frame, a project investigating the extent of vignetting effects in
      APOGEE-2S data would likely begin with examining spatial magnitude deviation plots. Spatial magnitude deviation
      plots, which color-code each fiber's flux with respect to an expected baseline, map out the
      plug plate's field of view. These plots are available per exposure series
      for a given MJD and plate, along with additional plots from calibration fibers. As a starting point,
      we might use these to identify general trends for magnitudes below expected value by night.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      The above figure is a typical example of such plots. The colorbar indicates whether a particular
      fiber's flux is below, at, or above its expected magnitude. Here, most target fibers are near baseline, especially towards
      the center of the field. However, as we increase distance out from the center, several fibers right along
      the outer edges (lower left and upper right) are between -0.15 and -0.50 less than expected. In this particular
      exposure, it is mainly these outer fibers with a deviating magnitude. This is how we would expect vignetting to
      arise in graphs of flux as a function of position on the plate. However, we would not be able to attribute this
      to vignetting without further investigation. Following this initial examination, we would take the analysis
      further to include additional parameters, in order to determine any other causes or contributors to low flux. Some
      questions to consider are:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How does long-term fiber performance contribute to low-flux readings? Are there specific
        fibers that have consistently lower-than-expected flux values at the edges? Is this still true
        for the same fibers if they are positioned closer towards the center (i.e. not plugged near the FOV edges)?
        Is this low flux reading due to a poorly performing fiber, vignetting, or a combination of both?</li>
        <li>Do other parameters, such as cart, play significant roles in reduced edge flux readings? What does
        this look like over time?</li>
        <li>Are there other potential contributors, such as human plug error or weather, that could be the cause
        instead of vignetting?</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      The first point in question draws in fiber performance projects, understanding how fibers perform by plate, night,
      and over time. Understanding if it is vignetting rather than a bad fiber causing low fluxes, vice versa, or
      stacked effect from the two will be important for both QA projects.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      There are other areas of vignetting and spatial magnitude deviation to consider as well. This plot, for example,
      shows a rather unexpected distribution of magnitudes, where half the fibers are significantly brighter than expected
      while the other half is dimmer. To begin breaking this down to possible reasons, the night logs will become an
      important tool. A Python script could batch parse logs or htmls and determine if this was simply a bad exposure
      or noticeably bad weather. Once obvious causes are ruled out, more extensive data visualization would be the next step.
      Advanced, interactive spatial magnitude deviation plotting would be a potential next step. Pulling out metadata
      to look beyond position and flux may yield additional insight.

    <h3>Future Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      - More advanced spatial magnitude variability plots with hover interactivity to provide
      with metadata from each fiber within a given FOV.
